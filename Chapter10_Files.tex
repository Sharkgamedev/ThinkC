\section{Opening and Closing Files}
	
	Imagine you are writing a program to track a library's books. You would need to 
	read the data from a file containing a list of books and their information. In C, 
	we open the file using the {\tt fopen()} function, as shown in the following example:
	
\begin{verbatim}
		FILE *file = fopen("books.txt", "r");
		if (file == NULL) {
			printf("Error: Unable to open file.\n");
			return 1;
		}
		
		// Perform operations on the file, such as reading the list of books
		
		fclose(file);
\end{verbatim}
