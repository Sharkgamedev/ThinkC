<h1>Chapter 5 - Fruitful functions</h1>

<h2>Return values</h2>
    <p><a href="#return">Return</a>, <a href="#statement!return">statement!return</a>, <a href="#function!fruitful">function!fruitful</a>, <a href="#fruitful function">fruitful function</a>, <a href="#return value">return value</a>, <a href="#void">void</a>, <a href="#function!void">function!void</a></p>
    <p>Some of the built-in functions we have used, like the math functions, have produced results. That is, the effect of calling the function is to generate a new value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>double e = exp (1.0);
double height = radius * sin (angle);
</code></pre>
    <p>But so far all the functions we have written have been <b>void</b> functions; that is, functions that return no value. When you call a void function, it is typically on a line by itself, with no assignment -- there is nothing to store as no result was produced:</p>
    <pre><code>printLines (3);
countdown (n-1);
</code></pre>
    <p>In this chapter, we will create functions that produce results, or “fruit,” as opposed to our previous void functions, which produced nothing. I will refer to as <b>fruitful</b> functions because they yield results.</p>
    <p>The first example is <code>area</code>, which takes a <code>double</code> as a parameter, and returns the area of a circle with the given radius:</p>
    <pre><code>double area (double radius) 
{
    double pi = acos (-1.0); 
    double area = pi * radius * radius;
    return area;
}
</code></pre>
    <p>The first thing you should notice is that the beginning of the function definition is different. Instead of <code>void</code>, which indicates a void function (that will not produce a fruit), we see <code>double</code>, which indicates that the return value (the fruit) from this function will have type <code>double</code>.</p>
    <p>Also, notice that the last line is an alternate form of the <code>return</code> statement that includes a return value. This statement means, “return immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value.” The type of the expression in the <code>return</code> statement must match the return type of the function. In other words, when you declare that the return type is <code>double</code>, you are making a promise that this function will eventually produce a <code>double</code>. If you try to <code>return</code> with no expression, or an expression with the wrong type, the compiler will take you to task. The purpose of our function prototypes is to let the compiler know the type of the parameters and return value of our function.</p>


  <p>The prototype for this function would be:</p>
  <pre><code>double area (double ) ;
</code></pre>
  <p>When we define a fruitful function we can only return one value. The return expression you provide can be arbitrarily complicated, but it must yield only one value. We could have written this function more concisely, but ultimately we only return one value:</p>
  <pre><code>double area (double radius) 
{
    return acos(-1.0) * radius * radius;
}
</code></pre>
  <p><a href="#temporary variable">Temporary</a>, or <a href="#variable!temporary">local</a>, variables like <code>area</code> and <code>pi</code> often make debugging easier and help to break up concepts into smaller more manageable parts.</p>
  <p>There are two main schools of thought when it comes to returning from functions.</p>
  <p>One idea is that functions should have only one return statement, a single exit point. Others favor multiple returns. This book takes no stance on this issue -- other than we strive to write readable and maintainable code. Sometimes this means we have single exit point, while other times using multiple return statements to return early from a function. We will note that single exit functions can be easier to debug because they uses local variables to store return results. We use multiple return statements in this absolute value example:</p>
  <pre><code>double absoluteValue (double x) 
{
    if (x &lt; 0) 
    {
        return -x;
    } 
    else 
    {
        return x;
    }
}
</code></pre>
  <p>Since these returns statements are in an alternative conditional, only one will be executed. Having more than one <code>return</code> statement in a function, means as soon as a return is executed, the function terminates without executing any subsequent statements. This can be used to exit a function when we know there is no point in executing the remaining code:</p>
  <pre><code>/*
this function returns 0 if either 
x or y are negative otherwise it returns
their product
*/
double earlyReturnExample (double x) 
{
    if (x &lt; 0)   //gaurd from x being negative
    {
        return 0;
    } 

    if (y &lt; 0)   //gaurd from y being negative
    {
        return 0;
    } 

    return x * y;
}
</code></pre>
  <p>Code that appears after a <code>return</code> statement, or any place else where it can never be executed, is called <b>dead code</b>. Some compilers warn you if part of your code is dead.</p>
  <p>If you put return statements inside a conditional, then you have to guarantee that <em>every possible path</em> through the program hits a return statement. For example:</p>
  <pre><code>double AbsoluteValue (double x) 
{
    if (x &lt; 0) 
    {
        return -x;
    } 
    else if (x &gt; 0) 
    {
        return x;
    }                          /* WRONG!! */
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program is not correct because if <code>x</code> happens to be 0, then
neither condition will be true and the function will end without hitting
a return statement.  Unfortunately, many C compilers do not catch
this error.  As a result, the program may compile and run, but the
return value when <code>x==0</code> could be anything, and will probably
be different in different environments.</p>

<p>By now you are probably sick of seeing compiler errors, but as you
gain more experience, you will realize that the only thing worse
than getting a compiler error is <em>not</em> getting a compiler error
when your program is wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the kind of thing that's likely to happen: you test <code>absoluteValue()</code> with several values of <code>x</code> and it seems to work
correctly.  Then you give your program to someone else and they run it
in another environment.  It fails in some mysterious way, and it
takes days of debugging to discover that the problem is an
incorrect implementation of <code>absoluteValue()</code>.  If only the
compiler had warned you!</p>

<p>From now on, if the compiler points out an error in your program, you
should not blame the compiler.  Rather, you should thank the compiler
for finding your error and sparing you days of debugging.  Some
compilers have an option that tells them to be extra strict and report
all the errors they can find.  You should turn this option on all the
time.</p>

<p>As an aside, you should know that there is a function in the
math library called <code>fabs()</code> that calculates the absolute
value of a <code>double</code> -- correctly.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Program development</h2>
  <p>At this point you should be able to look at complete C functions
and tell what they do.  But it may not be clear yet how to go
about writing them.  I am going to suggest one technique that
I call <b>incremental development</b>.</p>

  <p>As an example, imagine you want to find the distance between two
points, given by the coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.  By
the usual definition,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>The first step is to consider what a <code>Distance</code> function
should look like in C.  In other words, what are the inputs
(parameters) and what is the output (return value).</p>

  <p>In this case, the two points are the parameters, and it is natural to
represent them using four <code>double</code>s.  The return value is the
distance, which will have type <code>double</code>.</p>

<h2>Program development</h2>
  <p>Already we can write an outline of the function:</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      double distance (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) 
      {
          return 0.0;
      }
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>The <code>return</code> statement is a placekeeper so that the function will
  compile and return something, even though it is not the right answer.
  At this stage the function doesn't do anything useful, but it is
  worthwhile to try compiling it so we can identify any syntax errors
  before we make it more complicated.</p>

  <p>In order to test the new function, we have to call it with
  sample values.  Somewhere in <code>main()</code> I would add:</p>

  <pre>
    <code>
      double dist = distance (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0);
      printf  ("%f\n" dist);
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>I chose these values so that the horizontal
  distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that way,
  the result will be 5 (the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle).
  When you are testing a function, it is useful to know the right
  answer. Before you test any code you should 
  state what you expect the output to be.</p>

  <p>Once we have checked the syntax of the function definition, we
  can start adding lines of code one at a time.  After each
  incremental change, we recompile and run the program.  That
  way, at any point we know exactly where the error must be---in
  the last line we added.</p>

  <p>The next step in the computation is to find the differences
  <code>x2 - x1</code> and <code>y2 - y1</code>.  I will store those values in
  temporary variables named <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>.</p>

  <pre>
    <code>
      double distance (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) 
      {
          double dx = x2 - x1;
          double dy = y2 - y1;
          printf  ("dx is %f\n",  dx);
          printf  ("dy is %f\n", dy;
          return 0.0;
      }
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>I added output statements that will let me check the intermediate
  values before proceeding.  As I mentioned, I already know that they
  should be 3.0 and 4.0.</p>

  <p>When the function is finished I will remove the output statements.  Code
  like that is called <b>scaffolding</b>, because it is helpful for
  building the program, but it is not part of the final product.
  Sometimes it is a good idea to keep the scaffolding around, but
  comment it out, just in case you need it later.</p>

  <p>The next step in the development is to square <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>.
  We could use the <code>pow()</code> function, but it is simpler and
  faster to just multiply each term by itself.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  double Distance (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
  {
      double dx = x2 - x1;
      double dy = y2 - y1;
      double dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy;
      printf  ("d_squared is %f\n", dsquared);
      return 0.0;
  }
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Again, I would compile and run the program at this stage
and check the intermediate value (which should be 25.0).</p>

<p>Finally, we can use the <code>sqrt()</code> function to compute and
return the result.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  double distance (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) 
  {
      double dx = x2 - x1;
      double dy = y2 - y1;
      double dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy;
      double result = sqrt (dsquared);
      return result;
  }
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Then in <code>main()</code>, we should output and check the value of the result.</p>

<p>As you gain more experience programming, you might find yourself
writing and debugging more than one line at a time.  Nevertheless,
this incremental development process can save you a lot of
debugging time.</p>

<p>The key aspects of the process are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with a working program and make small, incremental
    changes.  At any point, if there is an error, you will know
    exactly where it is.</li>
  <li>Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so
    you can output and check them.</li>
  <li>Once the program is working, you might want to remove
    some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into
    compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program
    difficult to read. We call this refactoring the code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Composition</h2>

<p>As you should expect by now, once you define a new function,
you can use it as part of an expression, and you can build
new functions using existing functions.  For example, what if someone
gave you two points, the center of the circle and a point on
the perimeter, and asked for the area of the circle?</p>

<p>Let's say the center point is stored in the variables <code>xc</code>
and <code>yc</code>, and the perimeter point is in <code>xp</code> and
<code>yp</code>.  The first step is to find the radius of the circle, which
is the distance between the two points.  Fortunately, we have
a function, <code>Distance()</code>, that does that.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  double radius = distance (xc, yc, xp, yp);
  </code>
</pre>

<p>The second step is to find the area of a circle with that
radius, and return it.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  double result = area (radius);
  return result;
  </code>
</pre>



<p>Wrapping that all up in a function, we get:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  double areaFromPoints (double xc, double yc, double xp, double yp) 
  {
      double radius = distance (xc, yc, xp, yp);
      double result = area (radius);
      return result;
  } 
  </code>
</pre>

<p>The temporary variables <code>radius</code> and <code>area</code> are
useful for development and debugging, but once the program is
working we can make it more concise by composing
the function calls, but we should always favor readability over conciseness:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  double areaFromPoints (double xc, double yc, double xp, double yp) 
  {
      return area (distance (xc, yc, xp, yp));
  } 
  </code>
</pre>


<h2>Boolean values</h2>

<p>The types we have seen so far can hold very large values.  There are a lot
of integers in the world, and even more floating-point numbers.
By comparison, the set of characters is pretty small.  Well, many computing
languages implement an even more fundamental type that is even smaller.  It is called
<strong>_Bool</strong>, and the only values in it are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, earlier versions of the C standard did not implement boolean as
a separate type, but instead used the integer values 0 and 1 to represent 
truth values. By convention 0 represents <code>false</code> and 1 represents <code>true</code>. 
Strictly speaking C interprets any integer value different from 0 as true. This
can be a source of error if you are testing a value to be true by comparing it with <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Without thinking about it, we have been using boolean values in the
last of chapter.  The condition inside an <code>if</code>
statement is a boolean expression.
Also, the result of a comparison operator is a boolean value.
For example:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  if (x == 5) 
  {
    /* do something*/
  }
  </code>
</pre>

<p>The operator <code>==</code> compares two integers and produces a
boolean value.</p>


<p>Pre C99 has no keywords for the expression of <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
A lot of programs instead are
using C preprocessor definitions anywhere a boolean expression is called for.
For example,</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  #define FALSE 0
  #define TRUE 1
   ...
  if (TRUE) 
  {
    /* will be always executed  */
  }
  </code>
</pre>

<p>is a standard idiom for a loop that should run forever (or
until it reaches a <code>return</code> or <code>break</code> statement).</p>

<h2>Boolean variables</h2>

<p>Since boolean values are not supported directly in C, we can not declare
variables of the type boolean. 
Instead, programmers typically use the <code>short</code> datatype in combination with 
preprocessor definitions to store truth values.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  #define FALSE 0
  #define TRUE 1
   ...
  short fred;
  fred = TRUE;
  short testResult = FALSE;
  </code>
</pre>

<p>The first line is a simple variable declaration;
the second line is an assignment, and the third line is a
combination of a declaration and as assignment, 
called an initialization.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>initialization</strong></li>
  <li><strong>statement!initialization</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As I mentioned, the result of a comparison operator is a boolean,
so you can store it in a variable</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  short evenFlag = (n%2 == 0);     /* true if n is even */
  short positiveFlag = (x > 0);    /* true if x is positive */
  </code>
</pre>

<p>and then use it as part of a conditional statement later</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  if (evenFlag) 
  {
      printf("n was even when I checked it");
  }
  </code>
</pre>

<p>A variable used in this way is called a <strong>flag</strong>,
since it flags the presence or absence of some condition.</p>

<h2>Logical operators</h2>

<p>There are three <strong>logical operators</strong> in C: AND, OR and NOT,
which are denoted by the symbols <code>&&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> and
<code>!</code>.  The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar
to their meaning in English.  For example <code>x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10</code>
is true only if <code>x</code> is greater than zero AND less than 10.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>semantics</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><code>evenFlag || n\%3 == 0</code> is true if <em>either</em> of
the conditions is true, that is, if <code>evenFlag</code> is true OR the
number is divisible by 3.</p>

<p>Finally, the NOT operator has the effect of negating or
inverting a bool expression, so <code>!evenFlag</code> is true
if <code>evenFlag</code> is false; that is, if the number is odd.</p>

<p>Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested
conditional statements.  For example, how would you write
the following code using a single conditional?</p>

<pre>
  <code>
  if (x > 0) 
  {
      if (x < 10) 
      {
          printf ("x is a positive single digit.\n");
      }
  }
  </code>
</pre>

<h2>Bool functions</h2>
<p>It is sometimes appropriate for functions to return <code>boolean</code> values just 
like any other return type. This is 
is especially convenient for hiding complicated tests inside
functions.  For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
int IsSingleDigit (int x)
{
    if (x >= 0 && x &lt; 10) 
    {
        return TRUE;
    } 
    else 
    {
        return FALSE;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The name of this function is <code>isSingleDigit()</code>.  It is common
to give such test functions names that sound like yes/no questions.
The return type is <code>int</code>, which means that again we need
to follow the agreement that 0 represents <code>false</code> and 1 
represents <code>true</code>. Every return
statement has to follow this convention, again, we are using
preprocessor definitions.</p>

<p>The code itself is straightforward, although it is a bit longer than
it needs to be.  Remember that the expression <code>x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10</code>
is evaluated to a <code>boolean</code> value, so there is nothing wrong with returning it
directly, and avoiding the <code>if</code> statement altogether:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
int iSingleDigit (int x)
{
    return (x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>main()</code> you can call this function in the usual ways:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
printf("%i\n", isSingleDigit (2));
short bigFlag = !isSingleDigit (17);
</code></pre>

<p>The first line outputs the value <code>true</code> because 2 is a
single-digit number.  Unfortunately, when C outputs <code>boolean</code> values, it
does not display the words <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>, but rather the
integers <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>The second line assigns the value <code>true</code> to <code>bigFlag</code>
only if 17 is <em>not</em> a positive single-digit number.</p>

<p>The most common use of boolean functions is inside conditional
statements:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
//very readable with the bool funciton - if is single digit
if (isSingleDigit (x))  
{
    printf("x is little\n");
} 
else 
{
    printf("x is big\n");
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Returning from <code>main()</code></h2>
<p>Now that we know functions that return values, we can look more closely at the 
return value of the <code>main()</code> function.
It's supposed to return an integer:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
int main (void)
</code></pre>

<p>The usual return value from <code>main()</code> is 0, which indicates that
the program succeeded at whatever it was supposed to to.  If something
goes wrong, it is common to return -1, or some other value that
indicates what kind of error occurred.</p>

<p>The C standard library <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> provides two predefined constants <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> and <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code>.
We can use these to return a descriptive result from our return statement.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main (void)
{
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;   /*program terminated successfully*/
}  
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you might wonder who this value gets returned to, since
we never call <code>main()</code> ourselves.  It turns out that when the
operating system executes a program, it starts by calling <code>main()</code>
in pretty much the same way it calls all the other functions.
When the program terminates it passes a value back 
that tells if the execution was successful or not. The operating system
can use this value to create error reports or even pass this value on 
to other programs.</p>

<p>There are even some parameters that can be passed to <code>main()</code>
by the system, but we are not going to deal with them for a little
while, so we define  <code>main()</code> as having no parameters:  <code>int main (void)</code>.</p>
